********************************************************************************

Testing correctness of Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 15 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), it checks the return
values of isOpen(), percolates(), numberOfOpenSites(), and isFull() in that order.
Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

Tests 13 through 15 test backwash.

Test 1: open predetermined list of sites using file inputs
  * filename = input6.txt
  * filename = input8.txt
  * filename = input8-no.txt
  * filename = input10-no.txt

        (to make sure you didn't store data in static variables)
==> passed

Test 10: open predetermined list of sites using file inputs,
         but permute the order in which methods are called

If one of the values in the table violates the performance limits
the factor by which you failed the test appears in parentheses.
For example, (9.6x) in the union() column indicates that it uses
9.6x too many calls.


Tests 2a-2f: Check whether the number of calls to union(), connected(), and find()
             is a constant per call to open(), isOpen(), isFull(), and percolates().
             The table shows the maximum number of union(), connected(), and
             find() calls made during a single call to open(), isOpen(), isFull(),
             and percolates().
